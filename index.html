        About Me
      </h3>
      <p>After Graduating college with a degree in biology, I decided to jump straight into the laboratory 
        and begin working. I soon realized that I enjoyed learning biology, but working in the lab wasn't 
        a place for me. I really wanted to get into tech, so I decided to start working on my masters 
        degree in bioinformatics. While pursuing this degree, I was taking several courses on coding 
        and realizing that I really did enjoy coding and learning the different languages. So I decided to 
        get into a coding bootcamp and I am glad that I made this decision.
